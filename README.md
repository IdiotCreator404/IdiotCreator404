Hello, I'm Sujal Adhikari
I have a strong interest in software development and enjoy continuously expanding my knowledge in programming. I am currently focusing on Python, exploring functions, data structures, and algorithms, while also working on projects to apply concepts and enhance my problem-solving abilities. Additionally, I am learning the fundamentals of web development and automation. My toolkit includes Python and JavaScript, along with development tools like Git and VSCode. My learning objectives involve mastering data structures, algorithms, and adhering to best practices in clean coding.
